1.) warning: in the working copy of 'Notebook/Dataset/stud.csv', LF will be replaced by CRLF the next time Git touches
This warning is related to line endings in text files when using Git, specifically the difference between 
Unix-style line endings (LF) and Windows-style line endings (CRLF).

Here’s what could be causing the warning:

1. DIFFERENT OPERATING SYSTEMS: If you’re working on a project across different operating systems 
(e.g., Linux or macOS uses LF, while Windows uses CRLF), Git is trying to manage these differences.

2. GIT'S AUTO CRLF CONVERSION: Git has a setting called `core.autocrlf` which automatically converts 
LF to CRLF when checking out text files on Windows and back to LF when committing. The warning is indicating 
that Git will replace LF with CRLF the next time it interacts with the file.

3. MIXED LINE ENDINGS: If the file has mixed line endings (some lines ending with LF, others with CRLF),
 Git could be issuing this warning to alert you that it's going to standardize the file's line endings.

SOLUTIONS:

ENSURE CONSISTENT LINE ENDINGS: You can normalize the line endings across your project by running:
'''
  git add --renormalize .
  git commit -m "Normalize line endings"
'''
ADJUST GIT SETTINGS: You can configure Git to handle line endings differently by setting `core.autocrlf` to 
`true`, `false`, or `input` depending on your needs:
 '''
  git config --global core.autocrlf true
 '''
  - true: Convert LF to CRLF on checkout, and CRLF to LF on commit (recommended for Windows).
  - input: Convert CRLF to LF on commit, but leave LF on checkout (recommended for Unix systems).
  - false: Leave line endings as they are.

Choosing the right setting based on your operating system and team environment can prevent these warnings.
